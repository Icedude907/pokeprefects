Hi, Sorry to keep you waiting!
Welcome to the world of GAMERS!
My name is ~~BIRCH~~ MATPAT,
But everyone calls me a GAMING theorist

--next scene--

This is what we call a GAMER
(Picture of nerdy gamer)

This world is widely inhabited by creatures called GAMERS
we humans live alongside GAMERS
as they typically live inside the basements of humans they deem their parents
at times we dain to interact as playmates, and
at times as player two in Co-op GAMES.
sometimes they band together and battle others like them
in hypercompetitive button mashing. 

But despite our closeness, we don't know everything about GAMERS.
In fact, there are many, many secrets surrounding GAMERS.
To unravel GAMING mysteries, I've been undertaking research.
That's what I do.

And you are?
Are you a boy?
Or are you a girl?

-- boy / girl --
Boy(Brendan) sprite has MLG glasses on it
Girl(May) sprite is replaced with bathwater
(Make sure to replace the sprites on the naming screen)

All right.
What's your name?
So it's {PLAYER}{KUN}?
Ah, okay!
You're {PLAYER}{KUN} who's moving to my homestate of OHIO.
I get it now!

All right, are you ready?
Your very own GAMING adventure is about to unfold.
Take courage, and leap into the world of GAY...

-- Cuts to the end screen --

Music could be replaced with soundbites of gamers screaming
