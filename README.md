# Pokémon Prefects

**This is not a game. There is no overworld or any battles.**
This is a joke based on Pokemon Emerald (or 2 minutes of it at least).

Download the patch from the releases tab. Must be applied to an [official Pokemon Emerald rom](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1961) (`sha1: f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`)

It builds the following ROM:
* **pokeprefects.gba**

If you wish to build the game yourself, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
